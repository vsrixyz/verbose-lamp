# The process of structured ideation

A common misconception about creativity is that it involves generating something out of nothing. Creativity is about generating something from another something. Every idea is a remix. 

Remixing ideas is how humans navigate the world. We observe and emulate and adapt. And we are not alone. Life itself is process of emulation and adapation. Every molecule in your body was in a dinosaur once. There is nothing new under the sun. 

It's this misconception that lead some to believe that good ideas arrive as lightning strikes do: in a flash of brilliance, sudden and unexpected. But if you believe that ideas are merely remixes of other ideas, you can hasten the arrival of good ideas.

Structured ideation (or brainstorming) is a process developed by Alex Faickney Osborn (1888–1966), an advertising executive and founder of BBDO. His principles of structured ideation are straightforward:

## Four principles

- Go for quantity
- Defer judgment
- Embrace wild ideas
- Leapfrog

Let's explore each principle and why it helps produce ideas.

### Go for quantity

!["If you want to have good ideas you must have many ideas. Most of them will be wrong, and what you have to learn is which ones to throw away.”-Linus Pauling](_images/2021-02-18-pauling.png)

Like spermatazoa racing for the egg, it's a numbers game. Let's assume it takes 15 minutes for a single person to generate 50 ideas, and 2% turn out to be useful. With a group of five that's:

> 5 people x 200 ideas per hour x 2% = 20 usable ideas

It takes 1,000 generated ideas to walk away with 20 usable ideas. And if you think that's easy, try coming up with 50 title ideas for your own autobiography in 15 minutes. Should be easy, right? Try it and see. 

More is better. More people, more time, more ideas.

## Defer judgment

In other words, "no nos." Defer judgement in the generation process. The improv principle of "Yes, and" is useful here. Welcome all suggestions, tangents, or potential duds. It's a numbers game, after all.

The main reason to defer judgment, however, is to preserve momentum. Creativity is generating something from something, and the more *somethings* there are flying around, the more ideas you are likely to generate.
