# TSA comment card

## Before
Of the many things wrong with the Transport Security Administration (TSA) improving their comment cards is probably low on the priority list. But feedback really does help processes improve. Customers’ feedback provides a window to their psyche, and only by understanding a user can you design an experience that works for them. 

Handwritten feedback may seem old hat, but not everyone is on Twitter. Especially the billions of people that fly through the air every day. Comment cards, and especially the TSA’s, should be useful, readable, and conducive to generating the kind of feedback that can make the service better.

This is what it looks like:

## After
Of course, one of the "many things wrong with the TSA" is that it’s a bureaucracy. Without working there, I can’t know which components of this form are mandatory by law and which are kept around because “they’ve always done it that way.” I suspect more than a few. Nevertheless, I was conservative in redesigning this content. 

There is no “front” on a two-sided card, so each side must sufficiently convey the cards meaning, purpose, and value to whoever picks it up. The title “TSA Customer Comment Card” is included a short subheading indicating what the reader can expect on the other side.

The experience is now broken into four sections:

- About your trip
- Airport information
- Your experience (which replaces the abrupt `COMPLIMENT/COMPLAINT(Summarize):`)
- Follow up

In about your trip
